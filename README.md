Pytorch codes for Federated Generalized Face Presentation Attack  Detection <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06595.pdf> (pdf) </a> in TNNLS 2022.


A face presentation attack detection (fPAD)  model with good generalization can be obtained when it is trained with face images from different input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality, training data are not directly shared between data owners due to legal and privacy issues. In this paper, with the motivation of circumventing this challenge, we propose a Federated Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection (FedGPAD) framework, studying the generalization issue of federating learning for fPAD in a data privacy preserving way.
